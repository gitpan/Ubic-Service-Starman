# DESCRIPTION

This service is a common ubic wrap for psgi applications.
It uses starman for running these applications.

It is a very simple wrapper around [Ubic::Service::Plack](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Ubic::Service::Plack) that
uses [starman](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?starman) as the binary instead of [plackup](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?plackup).  It
defaults the `server` argument to 'Starman' so you don't have to pass
it in, and adds the ability to reload (which will gracefully restart
your [Starman](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Starman) workers without any connections lost) using
`ubic reload service_name`.

# NAME

Ubic::Service::Starman - ubic service base class for psgi applications

# METHODS

- reload

Reload adds the ability to send a `HUP` signal to the [Starman](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Starman) server
to gracefully reload your app and all the workers without losing any
connections.
